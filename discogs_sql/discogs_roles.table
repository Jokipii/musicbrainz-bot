Contralto Vocals	N	Vocal		A few popular music enthusiasts define the contralto and alto separately, as the contralto having an especially dark range, from the D above low C to Tenor C, which is essentially a female of tenor range, while alto is a voice with a range from G below middle C to the F an eleventh above middle C, and is closer to the mezzo-soprano. The majority however define contralto and alto as synonyms, and assign the adjectives light and dark, with a dark alto being a female of tenor range, while a light alto, commonly referred to as simply alto, to include mezzo-sopranos as well.	117	60	vocal	230	contraalto	149	\N

Harmonica	N	Instruments	Wind instruments	A free reed wind instrument which is played by blowing air into it or drawing air out by placing lips over individual holes (reed chambers) or multiple holes. The pressure caused by blowing or drawing air into the reed chambers causes a reed or multiple reeds to vibrate up and down creating sound. Each chamber has multiple, variable-tuned brass or bronze reeds which are secured at one end and loose on the other end, with the loose end vibrating and creating sound. The harmonica is used in blues and American folk music, jazz, classical music, country music, rock and roll, and pop music. The harmonica has other nicknames, especially in blues music, including: "harp," "blues harp," and "mouth organ."	502	44	instrument	66	harmonica	148	\N

Electric Upright Bass	N	Instruments	Stringed instruments	(also EUB, Stick Bass, Baby Bass) - An electronically amplified version of the double bass that has a smaller or non-existent body, which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument, as well as enhances the feedback resistance of the amplified instrument. The EUB retains enough of the features of the double bass so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it. While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass, its electrically-amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound. Although invented in the 1930s, it wasn't really until the introduction in the late 1950s of the Ampeg Baby Bass that the concept took off.	324	44	instrument	72	electric upright bass	148	\N

Other sound synthesis methods, like subharmonic synthesis or granular synthesis, are not commonly found in hardware music synthesizers.

Idiophone	N	Instruments	Drums and percussion	An idiophone is any musical instrument which creates sound primarily by way of the instrument vibrating itself, without the use of strings or membranes. Idiophones are probably the oldest type of musical instrument (not counting the human voice). Most percussion instruments which are not drums are idiophones. Struck idiophones (sometimes called concussion idiophones) include most of the non-drum percussion instruments familiar in the west. They include all idiophones which are made to vibrate by being hit, either directly with a stick or hand (like the wood block, singing bowl, triangle or marimba), or indirectly, by way of a scraping or shaking motion (like maracas or flexatone). Various types of bells fall into both categories. The other three sub-divisions are rarer. They are plucked idiophones, such as the jew's harp, amplified cactus, music box or mbira (lamellophone / thumb piano); blown idiophones, of which there are a very small number of examples, the Aeolsklavier being one; and friction idiophones, such as the singing bowl, glass harmonica, glass harp, turntable, verrophone, daxophone, styrophone, musical saw, or nail violin (a number of pieces of metal or wood rubbed with a bow). A number of idiophones that are normally struck, such as vibraphone bars and cymbals, can also be bowed.	186	44	instrument	\N	\N	148	\N

At one end a sheep membrane is stretched with a hole in this skin's center. Through this hole a tuft of horse hair with a knot at one end is passed. Usually two performers are needed to operate the instrument, one to hold the instrument, the other to pull the horsehair with moistened fingers.	153	44	instrument	\N	\N	148	\N
Jew's Harp	N	Instruments	Other musical	Also jaw harp, jaws harp, Jew's trump, guimbarde, juice harp, or mouth harp - A flexible metal or bamboo tongue or reed attached to a frame. The tongue/reed is placed in the performer's mouth and plucked with the finger to produce a note. The frame is held against the performer's teeth or lips, using the jaw (thus "jaw harp") and mouth as a resonator, greatly increasing the volume of the instrument. The note thus produced is constant in pitch, though by changing the shape of his or her mouth and the amount of air contained in it the performer can cause different overtones to sound and thus create melodies.	606	44	instrument	104	jew's harp	148	\N

Steel Guitar	N	Instruments	Stringed Instruments	Refers to at least three types of horizontally played guitar: "Pedal Steel Guitar" (Discogs credit "Steel Guitar [Pedal]")- A type of Electric guitar that uses a metal slide to stop the strings, rather than fingers on strings as with a conventional guitar. The pedal steel is placed horizontally on a stand, with the strings facing up towards the player, and is typically plucked with fingerpicks. The instrument's pedals are used to change the pitch of its strings while being played; the action of the pedals may either be fixed, or may be configurable by the player to select which strings are affected by the pedals. The pedal steel, with its smooth portamenti, bending chords and complex riffs, is one of the most recognizable and characteristic instruments of American country music. "Console Steel Guitar" (Discogs credit "Steel Guitar [Console]")- (also table steel guitar) A type of electric steel guitar intermediate between the lap steel guitar and the pedal steel guitar. Table steel guitars typically have multiple necks and/or more than six strings per neck, and are too large to be easily played in lap steel fashion. "Lap Steel Guitar" (Discogs credit "Steel Guitar [Lap]") - A guitar in which the strings are raised at both the nut and bridge ends of the fingerboard, typically to about half an inch. This makes the frets unusable, and they may be replaced by markers on some guitars.	403	44	instrument	80	steel guitar	148	\N
Fiddle	N	Instruments	Stringed instruments	A violin, often used in folk music. One very slight difference between "fiddles" and ordinary violins may be seen in American (e.g., bluegrass and old-time music) fiddling: in these styles, the top of the bridge may be cut so that it is very slightly less curved. This reduces the range of right-arm motion required for the rapid string-crossings found in some styles, and is said to make it easier to play double stops and shuffles (bariolage), or to make triple stops possible, allowing one to play chords.	327	44	instrument	85	fiddle	148	\N
